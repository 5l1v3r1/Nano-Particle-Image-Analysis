This repository contains a python package `npia` which can be used to identify nanoparticles in AFM images and determine their size and spacing. 

The dependencies are as follows:
* numpy
* mahotas - this is the core image analysis tool
* matplotlib
* pandas
* pillow

An example notebook can be found in the `notebooks` directory.  

Have fun!
